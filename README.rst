`pyfod`
=======

|build| |coverage| |zenodo|

The `pyfod <https://github.com/prmiles/pyfod/wiki>`_ package is a Python
repository for performing fractional-order derivative operations.  Several different definitions of fractional derivative are available within the package:

- Riemann-Liouville
- Caputo (development)
- Gr√ºnwald-Letnikov (development)

For now, the package is designed specifically for problems where the fractional order is between 0 and 1.  Accomadating a broader range of fractional order values will be a feature added as time permits.
